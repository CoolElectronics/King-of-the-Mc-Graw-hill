King-of-the-Mc-Graw-hill
This is a game me and a team of devs in middle school are making. It's about education. During the development of this game, many side projects have come into existence, to be finished, or tossed into the monumental "On-hold" pile. While development on King of the mc-graw hill has not stopped, it has become a metaphor for all of the prototypes and ideas of the team. Have fun browsing!
